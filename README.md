# DAXKitting
A continuation of Kurt Hatlevik's Kitting module for Dynamics AX 2012

See https://kurthatlevik.com/2012/09/25/ax-2012kitting-revisited/

This project was built on R3 CU13 with the Retail and Call Center modules enabled.

*** IMPORTANT NOTE ***
This model does not include the changes to purchase ordering.  If you want to include that you will need to extract those objects from the original file from Kurt.

You can download the archive of the original version from Kurt here: https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=daxkitting
NOTE: The archive file downloaded from CodePlex obfuscates the files in the releases/0 folder. One has to open the releaseList.json file in the releases folder and use that to rename the files in the /0 folder, which are XPO and axmodel files, plus documentation.
